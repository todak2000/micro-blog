# Simple Blogging Platform API documentation

This is the Offical API documentation for a simple blogging platform API using Firebase, React Query, and other technologies. The project aims to create a user-friendly website where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

API endpoints can be found [here](src/pages/api/index.tsx) at `src/pages/api/index.tsx`.

ONCE AGAIN ensure that you have a Firebase account and a project with Firestore database enabled as it would require that the Firebase api keys and other variables be used. Kindly refer to `.env.example` for guidance.
